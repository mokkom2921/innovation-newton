        <p>SDG 7 is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. Its aim is to “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all” . The three core targets of SDG 7 are
            to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services .</p>
        <br>
        <p>Lack of access to energy supplies and transformation systems is a constraint to human and economic development. The environment provides a series of renewable and non-renewable energy sources i.e. solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, biofuels,
            natural gas, coal, petroleum, uranium. Increased use of fossil fuels without actions to mitigate greenhouse gases will have global climate change implications. Energy efficiency and increase use of renewables contribute to climate change mitigation
            and disaster risk reduction .</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are several targets linked to the environment for SDG 7:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Target 7.1: By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services</li>
            <li>Target 7.2: By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix</li>
            <li>Target 7.3: By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency</li>
            <li>Target 7.a: By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy
                infrastructure and clean energy technology</li>
            <li>Target 7.b: By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries .</li>
        </ul>
