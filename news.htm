                        In conjunction with the Global Day of Action for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs) on 25 September, Sunway Malls together with Sunway REIT is raising awareness on the importance of upholding its commitment

                <p>Johnson Controls, a global leader in building technologies and solutions, has enabled Sunway Pyramid mall, one of the largest shopping malls in Malaysia, to save more than RM3 million in annual energy cost consistently since the retrofit
                    in 2012. The result of a comprehensive chiller plant retrofit, the achievement exceeded the targets set by the Sunway management in its quest for improving energy efficiency and sustainability of the mega mall that opened in 1997.
                    <br><br>Johnson Controls was awarded the retrofit contract in a six-way tender exercise. The project scope was to replace the aging original installation to eliminate the use of HCFC refrigerant gas, and to improve the overall chiller
                    plant room efficiency. In addition, the project was to be carried out without downtime to the retailers and shoppers at the mall. Johnson Controls designed and installed an integrated software to optimize the performance of a series
                    of centrifugal water chillers (comprising seven units of 1,200 TR capacity and one unit of 550 TR capacity). <br><br>The solution exceeded the mall's energy efficiency targets within a year of project completion. It delivered a plant
                    room efficiency of 0.75 kW/TR or less, and exceeded the target of 30 percent reduction in energy consumption. The carbon dioxide reduction is estimated to reach 6,400 metric tons per year.</p>
